# DC_motor_driver
A motor driver for a single DC motor based on the 555 timer IC. With this IC it is possible to control the speed of the motor and with an H bridge the direction in witch the motor turns.

With the rotary potentiometer that is used in the circuit you can control the speed of the motor and with the ON-OFF-ON switch that is used in the same circuit the direction in witch the motor turns. Setting the switch to the OFF state the motor stops turning and setting the switch to one of the two ON states the motor turns in the corresponding direction. The motor driver has been successfully tested with a 9V battery and a 12V 6636rpm DC motor with body dimensions 24,1mm x 30,5mm (diameter x length). The rest of the characteristics of this hobby DC motor with model number RP280-CN-12280 are: stall current 1,017A, shaft diameter 2mm, torque at stall 157,3g.cm and weight 0,05kg.

All the informations about the project such as the electronic components and the circuitry are listed in the file motor_driver.pdf.
